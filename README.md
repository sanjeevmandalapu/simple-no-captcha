# simple-no-captcha
a very simple security question that involves no captcha reading

if you are bored of using the text captcha, or just want to try a simpler alternative, use this simple number based security question in your form

the logic is simple, so you can implement this in any programming language. I am adding in all the ones that I like/know.
